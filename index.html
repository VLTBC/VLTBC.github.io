            <p>--The first release of a satellite was in 1957 amidst the space race which took place during the peak of the Cold War. This race took place to establish dominance in the skies with Russia releasing the Sputnik satellite into space first. This put fear into America and its citizens, the fear of Russia attaching weapons to their satellites. Swiftly America’s best scientists were working to put their very own satellite in orbit. The first satellite NASA produced named the ‘Explorer 1’ was released into space in 1958, the Explorer 1“On that count, NASA succeeded. Explorer 1 sent data back to Earth for four months, ceasing communications on May 23, 1958.” (Howell) The main responsibility of the Explorer 1 was to detect cosmic rays emitted by the Sun. However, after a four-month period communication was lost with the satellite, bringing it to an unfortunate end. This launch was more of a proof of concept that proved we’re also capable of launching our own space fairing craft. </p>

            <p>--Today’s satellites aren’t used for warfare however they are used in a wide variety of ways like observing weather patterns, recording magnetic field fluctuations, and most importantly communication or other important information transfer. Using information from Inmarsat there are three different stages a signal has to go through before it is emitted either globally or locally.  The first stage is when the broadcaster sends information via a terminal which is often referred to as an uplink. The next stage of transmission is referred to as the transponder stage. “Once received by the orbiting satellite, onboard amplifiers boost the signal strength and change the frequency of the signal before it is relayed back to a designated Earth station(s) on the ground. This is also referred as the “transponder” stage.” ("A Straightfoward Introduction To Satellite Communications) Once the signal is amplified, the frequency of the signal is also changed before being sent back to earth stations, this stage is known as the transponder stage. The transmitters then send out either one or multiple signals to the Earth stations across the world, this third and final stage is known as downlink. As mentioned before, Earth stations receive signals from satellite access stations (SAS), these signals are received through a dish or a circular reflector.</p>

            <p>--The James Webb Telescope (JWST) helps us observe distant galaxies and star systems using Infrared light.
                Webb’s primary mirror takes red and infrared light which is (0.6-28.8 microns) and reflects it to it’s secondary mirror, which redirects the light into the instruments where it is recorded.
                The telescope only observe a certain amount of light, so scientists often use long exposure shots in order to gather as much surface area and detail of any light reaching us as possible.

            <p>--With the expansion of the universe, light visible to us and our instruments we use are a small fraction of the light actually emitted. Light emitted by galaxies and stars early on in the universe overtime has been shifted into the Infrared spectrum which is not visbile to most instruments. This shift in color is attributed to the expansion of the universe causing the light to be streched on it's journey of the observer. The shift in color on the spectrum is called "Redshift". Since JWST is capable of observing this light using infrared, we often use it to observe distant galaxies that formed early as 900 million years after the big bang. Due to this streching you can often identitify older galxies by their red hue, though they are galaxies their appreance aren't what scientists are used to observing. This is often atrributed to matter being a lot closer and clumped together, the gravity from all of this mass doesn't allow beautiful spiral galaxies like our own. Along with the lack of variety of elements stars didn't last as long and often collapsed into their core creating supernovae, with this came heavier elemts. As time went on stars became more sustainable.

                Gravitational lensing only occurs when a large body of mass is accumulated in a certain area, Usually caused by a galaxy cluster. This causes a warping of spacetime for the light around it to be visibly bent. The area causing the light to curve is called a Gravitational lens.

            <p>--Gravitational lensing is used as sort of a cheat code in astronomy. The warping of spacetime allows for light to pass through from distant galaxies that we wouldn’t be able to observe given the current limitations and light or clestial bodies blocking its path. Gravitational lensing has allowed for us to observe distant galaxies as far as 17 billion light years away, although this is only a small fraction of the obserable universe being close to 40 billion light years. Star systems are a lot harder to observe given how small they are compared to the scale of the other bodies. However due to gravitational lensing scientists over at NASA were able to observe the most distant star system at a staggering 9 billion light years away. 
                This equates to 170,000,000,000,000 Trillion Miles away.

            <p>--Harnessing advanced chipsets and satellite visual imagery to monitor plant nutrients enables scientists to accurately forecast crop growth. By closely tracking potassium levels, a vital nutrient facilitating stomatal opening crucial for gas exchange and water regulation, scientists can make precise predictions about crop yield. These insights empower scientists to fine-tune nutrient levels, optimizing crop efficiency and maximizing harvests for farmers.

                With the United States Census Bureau reporting a population surge of 1.6 million people in the past year, demand for food is set to soar, driving prices up. Improved crop growth efficiency not only ensures bountiful harvests but also boosts food availability, keeping produce affordable. Additionally, it curbs product wastage, lowering costs for farmers and enhancing overall profitability.</p>

          <p><cite>Satellites show promise as tool for monitoring crop development</cite> By WSU Insider</p>
            <p>--Nutrients play a pivotal role in plant growth, with potassium, for instance, enhancing vigor and disease resistance while aiding in starch, sugar, and oil formation, as highlighted by the Department of Primary Industries. Chloride, another essential nutrient, supports plant metabolism, photosynthesis, and ionic balance within cells, contributing to overall crop health.

                Beyond potassium and chloride, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are also critical for robust crop growth. By leveraging this nutritional data, scientists can tailor nutrient intake to meet specific crop needs, optimizing resource management and fostering healthier, more productive harvests.</p>

            <p> --The observed redshifts in early galaxies provide direct evidence of the universe's expansion, revealing the framework of the Big Bang theory. Galaxies with significant redshifts indicate they are hurtling away from us at tremendous speeds, propelled by the expansive forces shaping the universe. By studying the distribution of redshifts across different galaxies, astronomers can reconstruct the timeline of cosmic evolution, tracing the formation and evolution of galaxies from the early universe to the present day. Redshifted galaxies thus stand as celestial signposts guiding our exploration of the universe's mysterious past.</p>
